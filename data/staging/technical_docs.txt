Python FastAPI Framework Guide

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. It's built on top of Starlette for the web parts and Pydantic for the data parts.

Key Features:
- Fast: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go
- Fast to code: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%
- Fewer bugs: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors
- Intuitive: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging
- Easy: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs
- Short: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration
- Robust: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation

Docker and Kubernetes
Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to package applications and their dependencies into containers. Kubernetes is an orchestration platform for managing containerized applications at scale.

Machine Learning and AI
Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms are transforming software development. Neural networks, deep learning, data science, and cloud computing are essential technologies for modern AI applications.

Database Management
PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB are popular database systems. Object-relational mapping (ORM) libraries like SQLAlchemy help manage database operations in Python applications.

DevOps and Automation
Continuous integration, continuous deployment (CI/CD), infrastructure as code, monitoring, logging, and automated testing are core DevOps practices for reliable software delivery.
