üéØ Key Concepts:
- Agent Communication: How agents share information and coordinate tasks
- Task Distribution: Breaking complex problems into specialized agent responsibilities
- Resource Management: Efficiently allocating computational resources across agents
- Conflict Resolution: Managing competing objectives between different agents

üí° Practical Examples:
- Document Processing Pipeline: One agent extracts text, another analyzes content, a third generates summaries
- Multi-Modal Analysis: Separate agents for text, images, and data analysis working in concert
- Customer Service: Routing agents, knowledge agents, and response agents collaborating

üìö Further Learning:
- Study multi-agent systems (MAS) principles
- Explore distributed AI architectures
- Learn about agent communication protocols
- Practice with real-world agent orchestration scenarios

üöÄ Hands-on Exploration:
- Build simple agent chains
- Experiment with parallel agent execution
- Design agent communication patterns
- Implement error handling across agent networks";
