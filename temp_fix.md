# Temporary Fix Strategy

Instead of spending more time on OpenAPI compatibility issues, let me:

1. Comment out OpenAPI/Swagger code temporarily
2. Focus on getting core services to build and run
3. Address OpenAPI in a separate iteration

This will allow us to get the application running with .NET 10 first.
